using the frontend technologies i made the simon color game which was very intresting and make our remembraring strength more strong .

Gameplay:

1) Start simple: Begin with a short sequence of two or three colors. Demonstrate the sequence by lighting up the corresponding buttons or displaying them on the screen one after the other.
2) Player turn: The player then needs to correctly repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons or touching the designated areas on the screen.
3) Progression and difficulty: If the player succeeds, the level advances with a longer and more complex color sequence. You can gradually increase the difficulty by introducing faster speeds, incorporating mixed patterns within the sequence, or even adding additional colors to the palette.
